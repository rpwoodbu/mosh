    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
    <strong>NEW!</strong>
    Mosh Client for Chrome now supports ssh-based connection setup! Just fill
    in the fields, and just like the "mosh" command, an ssh connection will be
    made to the server to establish trust, start the mosh-server, and get the
    encryption key. Right now, only password auth is supported.
    <p>
    Should you need to setup the connection manually (e.g., cannot use password
    auth), choose "manual" mode. Then manually ssh to the remote machine and
    run 'mosh-server'. It will print the key and the port number; enter those
    into this form, as well as the IP address (not the hostname) of the remote
    machine, and click 'Connect'. 'mosh-server' gives you about a minute to do
    this before giving up and exiting. You can close your ssh session once
    'mosh-server' is running.


    <h3>Known issues</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>ssh fingerprint goes by too fast, with no option to confirm.
      <li>Only ssh password auth is currently supported.
      <li>Too easy to close the window by mistake.
      <li>x86_32 port is built with --disable-hardening, which reduces
        security somewhat.
      <li>Unicode input doesn't work (rendering does).
    </ul>

    <h3>Changelog</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>0.0.0.12 (2014-01-05) - Fix Unicode rendering (input still lacking).
        This also fixes the bad interaction with tmux, as tmux uses Unicode
        characters for drawing borders. This was accomplished by building
        against newlib instead of glibc (long story). This could be the source
        of new and exciting bugs. But besides fixing Unicode support, this
        paves the way for ARM support, and ultimately using Portable Native
        Client (PNaCl), which allows a single build to run on any architecture.
        (PNaCl doesn't yet support C++ exceptions, but when it does, we're
        ready.)
      <li>0.0.0.11 (2013-12-23) - Improved error reporting. stderr now goes to
        the terminal (just like the real mosh-client), and also the Javascript
        console. If in doubt, check the Javascript console, as the terminal may
        obscure errors.  <li>0.0.0.10 (2013-12-16) - Now permits hostnames as
        well as IP addresses. Crypto randomness is now actually random. Tested
        successfully on Linux and MacOS.  <li>0.0.0.9 (2013-12-15) - Fix for
        x86_32 failing to start. Tested on Linux; not yet tested on MacOS.
      <li>0.0.0.8 (2013-12-02) - Build against pepper_31 and newer naclports.
        Eliminate spurious new browser tab on connect.
      <li>0.0.0.7 (2013-11-30) - Add support for i686 (needed for 32-bit
        Chrome, e.g.  MacOS).
      <li>0.0.0.6 (2013-10-16) - Fix bug in readfrom() emulation which caused
        Mosh to show a crypto error, rendering the session useless.
      <li>0.0.0.5 (2013-10-15) - Clean up initial screen and add this info.
      <li>0.0.0.4 (2013-10-14) - Big code refactor.
      <li>0.0.0.3 (2013-10-08) - Fix bug in packet handling code which caused
        perceived sluggishness.
      <li>0.0.0.2 (2013-10-08) - Add application icon.
      <li>0.0.0.1 (2013-10-07) - Initial working version.
