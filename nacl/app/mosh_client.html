    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
    First manually ssh to the remote machine and run 'mosh-server'.
    It will print the key and the port number; enter those into this form,
    as well as the IP address (not the hostname) of the remote machine,
    and click 'Connect'. 'mosh-server' gives you about a minute to do this
    before giving up and exiting. You can close your ssh session once
    'mosh-server' is running.

    <h3>Known issues</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crypto randomness, well, isn't.
      <li>Bad interaction with tmux and windowed areas.
      <li>Must specify IP address, not hostname.
      <li>Most fatal errors only log to stderr, not to the screen.
      <li>Too easy to close the window by mistake.
    </ul>
