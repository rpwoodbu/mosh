Mosh Client port for Native Client (Chrome browser).
Main author: Richard Woodbury (rpwoodbu@mybox.org)

To build on Linux, just execute:

$ ./build.sh

This will download and build all dependencies. The directory "app" will contain
all the assets necessary to run the client in the browser. Go to
chrome://extensions, enable "Developer mode", and click the "Load unpacked
extension button", directing it to the "app" directory. Then the app will be
launchable from the app screen and the extensions screen.

If there are problems with the build (particularly with building dependencies),
you may need to delete the "build" directory to get a fresh start.

To distribute the app, just upload the .zip file found in the "app" directory.

The initial build will be very slow, as it has to download and build large
dependencies. Subsequent builds are much faster. To go even faster while
developing, including being able to build without updating dependencies (which
requires Internet access), execute:

$ ./build.sh fast

This will not work if you have not had a successful build in the "slow" mode.
Also note that it does not rebuild the .zip file, so DO NOT DISTRUBITE a "fast"
build.

To build on other platforms, you will need to get and setup the NaCl SDK and
naclports yourself, and set NACL_SDK_ROOT and NACL_PORTS appropriately (see
"build.sh" for hints). But all target platforms are cross-compiled from the one
you are running, so there is no reason to build on other platforms, other than
personal preference.
